  <p style="background-image:url(images/logo1.png)";>
Lubanzi Piggery established in 2019 in the area of Danganya, Durban South-Coast, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The piggery started with a gilt which produced only six piglets and from those six piglets the barn got expanded and as the pigs number increases we then bought another gilt which produced 12 litter. The company had been supported by the department of Agriculture of KwaZulu-Natal in the Umbumbulu district, by providing a veterinary doctor and a feed for the pigs. In the mid year 2019 we started to sell four weeks old piglets going to twelve weeks old piglets with the aim of helping those young and upcoming farmers who have more interest in piggery. This opened an opportunity for Lubanzi to train and mentor these farmers who are freshers in the industry, we also began selling a piggery starter which included the following: two Piglets, dewormer and iron medicines, 50 kg starter feed, notebook(records book), a texttile tape-measure. We managed to reach out to a number of farmers while at the same time building ties with other experienced farmers learning new ideas on how to raise pigs with affordable cost, this made Lubanzi Piggery Farming take a step towards marketing the company through social media on facebook, that is when we then became more busier than any other time more especially on selling whole pig carcases to the street vendors and other business people who runed food places or grill places as well as restaurants. The revenue was great in the year 2019 and ended that year with a good note.
