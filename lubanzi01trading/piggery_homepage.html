  <p class="par"   style="background-image:url(images/logo1.png)">
Lubanzi Piggery established in 2019 in the area of Danganya,<br> 
Durban South-Coast, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal in <br>
South Africa. The piggery started with a gilt which produced<br> 
only six piglets and from those six piglets the barn got expanded<br> 
and as the pigs number increases we then bought another gilt which<br>
produced 12 litter. The company had been supported by the department<br> 
of Agriculture of KwaZulu-Natal in the Umbumbulu district, by providing<br> 
a veterinary doctor and a feed for the pigs. In the mid year 2019 we<br> 
started to sell four weeks old piglets going to twelve weeks old piglets<br> 
with the aim of helping those young and upcoming farmers who have more <br>
interest in piggery. This opened an opportunity for Lubanzi to train and <br>
mentor these farmers who are freshers in the industry, we also began <br>
selling a piggery starter which included the following: two Piglets, <br>
dewormer and iron medicines, 50 kg starter feed, notebook(records book), <br>
a texttile tape-measure. We managed to reach out to a number of farmers <br>
while at the same time building ties with other experienced farmers <br>
learning new ideas on how to raise pigs with affordable cost, this made <br>
Lubanzi Piggery Farming take a step towards marketing the company through <br>
social media on facebook, that is when we then became more busier than any <br>
other time more especially on selling whole pig carcases to the street vendors <br>
and other business people who runed food places or grill places as well as <br>
restaurants. The revenue was great in the year 2019 and ended that year with a<br> 
good note. Our vision statement at Lubanzi Piggery Farming is to be recognised <br>
as the top leading pig farming business in the district and also to be counted <br>
amongst the top ten farming brands in the Province. Our Mission statement in <br>
the industry is to become number one reputable brand in the district that sells <br>
pigs and piglets, together with processed and packaged pork and other pig <br>
products at an affordable price.
