    <h1 class="heading"><b> HISTORY ABOUT LUBANZI PIGGERY FARMING</b></h1>
    <p class="par">
      Lubanzi Piggery established in 2019 in the area of Danganya,<br>
      
      Durban South-Coast, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. <br>
      
      The piggery started with a gilt which produced only six piglets and from <br>
      
      those six piglets the barn got expanded and as the pigs number increases we <br>
      
      then bought another gilt which produced 12 litter.<br> 
      
      
      The company had been supported by the department of Agriculture of KwaZulu-Natal <br>
      
      in the Umbumbulu district, by providing a veterinary doctor and a feed for the pigs.<br>
      
      In the mid year 2019 we started to sell four weeks old piglets going to twelve weeks <br>
      
      old piglets with the aim of helping those young and upcoming farmers who have more interest<br>
      
      in piggery.<br> 



      
      <br>
      This opened an opportunity for Lubanzi to train and mentor these farmers who are freshers <br>
      
      in the industry, we also began selling a piggery starter which included the following: two<br> 
      
      Piglets, dewormer and iron medicines, 50 kg starter feed, notebook(records book), a texttile <br>
      
      tape-measure. We managed to reach out to a number of farmers while at the same time building <br>
      
      ties with other experienced farmers learning new ideas on how to raise pigs with affordable <br>
      
      cost, this made Lubanzi Piggery Farming take a step towards marketing the company through <br>
      
      social media on facebook, that is when we then became more busier than any other time more <br>
      
      especially on selling whole pig carcases to the street vendors and other business people <br>
      
      who runed food places or grill places as well as restaurants.<br> 

         
      <br>
      The revenue was great in the year 2019 and ended that year with a good note. Our vision <br>
      
      statement at Lubanzi Piggery Farming is to be recognised as the top leading pig farming <br>
      
      business in the district and also to be counted amongst the top ten farming brands in the<br>
      
      Province. Our Mission statement in the industry is to become number one reputable brand in<br>
      
      the district that sells pigs and piglets, together with processed and packaged pork and other<br>
      
      pig products at an affordable price.<br>
