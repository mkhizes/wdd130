        We have a different way of breeding,caring and raising them under the eye of our best 
        veterinary doctor and the quality of the feed we offer them does turn into meat hence 
        they grow faster. With much clean water for drinking and hygenic barnes. Feed is the 
        biggest cost factor in pig production and can amount to 60 to 80 % of the total cost 
        of production. Correctly fed pigs will ensure:
        ● efficient reproduction and growth
        ● efficient feed utilisation 
        ● good-quality meat 
        ● maximum profit for the farmer.
        
        Pigs must therefore be fed the correct quantity of the right feed mixture. 
        The nutrient requirements, especially digestible energy and protein, 
        of the various production classes differ. These production classes include:
        ● boars and pregnant sows ● sows with piglets
        ● young pigs, three to 10 weeks old
        ● growing pigs up to slaughter at a live weight of 60 or 90 kg.
        
                
        We have the following services that we offer, we sell pigs milk, 
        breed the pigs, also do artificial insermination for those require for their sows, 
        sell the best manure with high potasium attained from pigs. 
        The gallery show off some of the operations that take place in the Lubanzi Piggery Farming.
        
        Feed sources
        Grains
        ● Grain constitutes between 55 and 70 % of the total feed mixture.          
        ● Pigs must now eat as much as possible to ensure quick growth.
        Growing pigs (10 weeks old up to slaughter)
        ● Fast-growing pigs that will produce a good-quality carcass with a high meat 
        and low fat percentage, can be fed as much as they will eat of MIXTURE 4. 
        ● They should also maintain maximum intake to ensure quick growth so that they can reach a marketable weight as
        soon as possible.
        ● Fresh clean water must be available at all times. Keep feed and water as far apart as possible to prevent the feed
        becoming wet.
