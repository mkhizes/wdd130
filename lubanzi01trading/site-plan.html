        We have a different way of breeding,caring and raising them under the eye of our best veterinary doctor and the quality of the feed we offer them does turn into meat hence they grow faster. With much clean water for drinking and hygenic bannes. Feed is the biggest cost factor in pig production and can amount to 60 to 80 % of the total cost of production. Correctly fed pigs
        will ensure:
        ● efficient reproduction and growth
        ● efficient feed utilisation ● good-quality meat ● maximum profit for the farmer.
        Pigs must therefore be fed the correct quantity of the right feed mixture. The nutrient requirements, especially digestible energy
        and protein, of the various production classes differ. These production classes include:
        ● boars and pregnant sows ● sows with piglets
        ● young pigs, three to 10 weeks old
        ● growing pigs up to slaughter at a live weight of 60 or 90 kg.
        Feed mixtures can either be bought or the farmer can mix them himself. The latter is less expensive but it is important to
        consult an expert on how to mix the feedstuffs that have to be included in the mixtures for each of the production classes. The
        various feedstuffs must be weighed off correctly before mixing.
        Feed mixtures for each of the pig classes must contain the right quantities of the following nutrients, namely:
        ● digestible energy (DE) ● proteins ● minerals
        ● vitamins
        We have the following services that we offer, we sell pigs milk, breed the pigs, also do artificial insermination for those require for their sows, sell the best manure with high potasium attained from pigs. 
        The gallery show off some of the opperations that take place in the Lubanzi Piggery Farming.
        Feed sources
        Grains
        ● Grain constitutes between 55 and 70 % of the total feed mixture.
        ● The grain in a mixture provides mainly energy (between 60 and 80 % of the total DE in the mixture).
        ● Although grain is mainly an energy source with a low protein content, it also contributes substantially (30 to 60 %) to
        the protein content of the mixture.
        ● Maize is used as a grain source in pig feeds because it is high in DE and low in protein and therefore used mainly as
        an energy source.
        ● Grain sorghum has a nutritional value similar to that of maize. Provided sweet sorghum (low tannin) varieties are used,
        sorghum can be substituted for maize on an equal basis in feed mixtures.
        ● Feed-grade wheat, when available at a cost not exceeding 20 % above that of maize, can also be used. The protein
        content of wheat is usually higher and the DE content lower than that of maize. Using wheat in stead of maize in feed
        mixtures could lead to considerable savings in protein costs. Wheat must always be coarsely ground when used for

        Nutrition
        feeding pigs.
        ● Barley is included mainly as a grain source in the Western Cape. It has a higher fibre content and a lower digestibleenergy content than other grain types. Barley should not comprise more than 70 % of the grain component of a
        mixture.
        ● Oats can be used but not more than 40 % should be included in mixtures for growing pigs and 60 % or less in
        mixtures for finishing pigs.
        Grain by-products
        Grain by-products such as wheat bran, maize bran, maize leaves, maize-stalks and maize-cobs are used to dilute the DE
        content of the mixture. Brans have a protein content higher than that of grains and are also relatively inexpensive.
        ● Wheat bran is the most popular DE diluent used in pig feeds. It is usually cost effective and has a laxative effect in
        pigs. When seasonal shortages occur, other diluents such as maize bran, maize leaves, maize-stalks, maize-cobs and
        lucerne can be used.
        ● Hominy chop, a by-product from the maize-milling industry, can be used when available at a reasonable price. It is a
        product that can vary a great deal depending on the miller it is bought from. It is higher in fat content than maize and
        can be used as a partial replacement for maize.
        Plant protein sources
        Oilcake meals
        Soya-bean oilcake meal and sunflower oilcake meal are plant protein feedstuffs usually included in pig feed mixtures. Soyabean oilcake is of a higher and better quality protein and contains considerably less fibre than sunflower oilcake.
        Full-fat oilseeds
        ● Full-fat soya-bean and sunflower seed meals have a high oil content. The oil results in soft fat in pig carcasses.
        Therefore, the inclusion of these two feedstuffs, if fed in combination with maize, must be limited in rations for finishing
        pigs. Full-fat soya-beans must be heat treated before use to destroy a substance (trypsin inhibitor) which reduces the
        growth rate of pigs.
        Lucerne
        ● Lucerne is also used as a DE diluent in pig feed mixtures. It has a high fibre and low DE content. Therefore, the
        inclusion of lucerne in feed mixtures for pigs must be limited. Lucerne also varies much in composition depending on
        the growth stage when cut, and on the extent of leaf loss during drying and baling.
        Animal protein sources
        By-products of the animal and fishing industry can be used as animal protein sources for pigs.
        Fishmeal
        Fishmeal is the most frequently used and best protein source to include in feed mixtures. It also has a high DE content.

        Nutrition
        Blood and carcass meal
        ● Bloodmeal has a very high nutritional value. Do not, however, use more than a maximum of 5 % in feed mixtures
        because it is unpalatable. It becomes burnt easily during processing, which has a detrimental effect on the quality of
        the proteins.
        ● Carcass meal can vary a great deal in composition and quality because manufacturers use different products and
        processing methods. Heat damage during processing can downgrade the quality of the proteins in carcass meal.
        Calcium and phosphorus sources
        ● Feed lime is a good calcium source and is not very expensive, but it contains no phosphate.
        ● Monocalcium phosphate, dicalciumphosphate and bonemeal are usually included as sources of phosphate. These
        sources also contain calcium, but in smaller quantities than feed lime.
        Waste products in pig feed mixtures
        Waste products must be used with great caution in pig rations.
        ● Kitchen refuse and byproducts from the bakery and other food-processing industries may contain toxic substances
        such as excessive quantities of salt and other additives which can be harmful to pigs.
        ● Even hard objects such as pieces of broken glass, which can injure the pigs, are sometimes found in waste products.
        ● These products are usually high in moisture (water) content and therefore have a very low nutritional value when fed
        in a wet form.
        ● Only use waste products in an air-dry form.
        ● Use a flat cemented area in the sun for drying the waste.
        ● Remove any undesirable material from the waste when it is spread out on the cemented area. After drying, grind the
        waste in a hammermill. The milled meal can then be used to replace part of the mealiemeal when mixing pig rations.
        ● Before using the waste-product meal it is advisable to have it analysed for protein, fat, fibre, calcium and phosphate
        content by an analytical laboratory. Thereafter it is important to get the advice of a pig nutritionist on how much of the
        dried waste meal must be included in a pig ration.
        Inclusion levels of feed sources in mixtures
        Maximum inclusion levels must not be exceeded when mixing feeds for the different pig production classes (see table).

        Feed requirements of the different production classes
        Breeding pigs
        Boars
        ● Boars must be kept in a good condition, which means that they must not be too lean or too fat.
        ● Feed the boar 2 kg/day of a sow-and-boar mixture (MIXTURE 1).
        ● If the boar becomes too lean/thin give it a little extra feed per day and slightly less when it becomes too fat.
        Dry and pregnant sows
        ● After sows are weaned (piglets removed from the sow) until they farrow (have their next piglets) a sow-and-boar
        mixture (MIXTURE 1) is provided at a rate of 2 kg/day.
        ● Make sure that the sow remains in a good condition during this period.
        ● Like the boar, the sow must not become too lean or too fat.
        ● Increase or decrease the quantity of feed slightly when necessary.
        Lactating sows (sows suckling piglets)
        ● Sows with piglets are fed a lactation mixture (MIXTURE 2).
        ● A sow with a large litter of piglets must produce enough milk to rear them properly.
        ● The sow should loose as little weight as possible while suckling her litter to remain in a good condition until the end of
        the lactation period. This will ensure that she comes on to heat within seven days after weaning with an excellent
        chance to again produce a large litter.
        ● On the day that the piglets are born sows are usually not interested in feed. Provide 2 kg of feed the next day and
        gradually increase the quantity up to a maximum at about seven days after farrowing.

        Nutrition
        ● The maximum quantity fed will depend on the number of piglets in the litter. A sow in good condition should be fed 2
        kg plus 0,4 kg/piglet in the litter. A sow with 10 piglets should therefore receive at least 6 kg of feed per day. Feed the
        sow more than the recommended quantity if she is willing to eat more to prevent weight loss during lactation.
        ● The daily quantity of feed can be provided in two equal portions mixed with water early in the morning and late in the
        afternoon. Sows take in more feed when it is mixed with water.
        ● Fresh clean water is very important and must be available to the sow and piglet at all times.
        Young pigs (three to 10 weeks old)
        ● A feed mixture for creep-fed and weaned piglets (MIXTURE 3) is provided to piglets from the time they start eating at
        3 weeks of age until they are about 10 weeks old and weigh between 25 and 30 kg.
        ● Piglets eat very little before they are weaned. Solid feed can, however, be provided to piglets
        before weaning. Always feed it in a dry form and make sure the trough is placed where the
        sow cannot reach it. Feed is expensive, therefore restrict wastage to a minimum.
        ● Provide MIXTURE 3 when the piglets are weaned.
        ● Feed must always be freely available in a dry meal form.
        ● Use an efficient self-feeder to put the feed in and make sure that as little feed as possible is
        wasted.
        ● Pigs must now eat as much as possible to ensure quick growth.
        Growing pigs (10 weeks old up to slaughter)
        ● Fast-growing pigs that will produce a good-quality carcass with a high meat and low fat percentage, can be fed as
        much as they will eat of MIXTURE 4. Dry meal fed in an efficient self-feeder must therefore be available to the pigs at
        all times.
        ● They should also maintain maximum intake to ensure quick growth so that they can reach a marketable weight as
        soon as possible.
        ● Fresh clean water must be available at all times. Keep feed and water as far apart as possible to prevent the feed
        becoming wet.
