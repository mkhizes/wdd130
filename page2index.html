    <u><b>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</b></u>
    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds 
    the Salmon river.The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as 
    the River of No Return by the people living near it because of 
    the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love 
    with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.Herds 
    of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear 
    and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor 
    is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over 
    the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun 
    or rain when needed.Let's not forget the rapids! They range from 
    class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in 
    the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher,
    faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and 
    warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...
    but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate 
    the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

    <u><b>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</b></u>
    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most 
    desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty 
    Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful 
    desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 
    84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid(just outside
    Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic 
    formations,evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and 
    great whitewater opportunities.Desolation is rated a Class II/III 
    and is usually done in 6 days.Desolation Canyon has been recognized 
    as a National Landmark.This designation is based on the 
    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

    <u><b>Grand Canyon, Arizona</b></u>
    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all 
    river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with 
    breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience.
    The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but 
    with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
    
    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. 
    The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to 
    accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, 
    most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so 
    we often refer to both.
